## ðŸŽ‰ News
- **[2025/10/24]**: ColorEcosystem is released! We have open-sourced the ColorEcosystem code on GitHub.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Agent Store**: Developers can publish remote A2A agents or MCP tools to the Agent Store.
- **Agent Carrier**: Users can enable agents or tools from the store, chat with their personal assistant agent to complete tasks by leveraging these tools, and even interact with friends' assistant agents.
- **Agent Audit**: Users can control and authorize which data their personal assistant agent is allowed to access.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
### 1. Repository overview
ColorEcosystem is implemented across several repositories:

Backend Services (microservices)
- color-gateway-service â€” API gateway for other backend services
- color-store-service â€” API for Agent/MCPTool and user management
- color-social-service â€” API for friend and user online management
- color-assistant-service â€” API for assistant and tool call management

Frontend Service
- color-store-portal â€” Web portal for developers' management console

Client App
- color-store-android â€” Android client app (prebuilt APK is provided)

Note: You do not need to clone all repositories. To deploy locally you should clone the four backend services (`color-*-service`). Clone the frontend service (`color-store-portal`) if you want to run the web portal. A prebuilt APK for the Android client is provided, so building the Android app from source is optional.

You can clone all repositories at once with:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To update all submodules later:
```
git submodule update --remote --recursive
```


### 2. Usage
#### 2.1 Run backend services
Clone the four backend service repositories and follow each repository's README to run them in the following order:
- [`color-gateway-service`](https://github.com/opas-lab/color-gateway-service.git)
- [`color-store-service`](https://github.com/opas-lab/color-store-service.git)
- [`color-social-service`](https://github.com/opas-lab/color-social-service.git)
- [`color-assistant-service`](https://github.com/opas-lab/color-assistant-service.git)

#### 2.2 Run frontend service
Follow the README of [`color-store-portal`](https://github.com/opas-lab/color-store-portal.git) to run the frontend service.

#### 2.3 Run Android app
Follow the README of [`color-store-android`](https://github.com/opas-lab/color-store-android.git) to run the Android client app, or use the provided prebuilt APK.
